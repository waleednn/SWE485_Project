## ðŸ“˜ Project Title
**Health Advice System**

---

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation (Why this problem/dataset?)  
Many people experience symptoms but struggle to understand what condition they might have or which type of doctor they should visit.  
This project aims to build a **Health Advice System** that can predict the possible **disease (prognosis)** based on a combination of symptoms reported by a patient.

The dataset was chosen because it provides a structured and comprehensive list of **132 medical symptoms** linked to **41 diseases**.  
Each symptom is represented as a binary indicator (0 = absent, 1 = present), making it ideal for **machine learning classification tasks**.

This dataset allows the team to:
- Explore supervised learning algorithms in healthcare applications.  
- Understand feature importance (which symptoms are most predictive).  
- Build a foundation for a future system that provides AI-based medical advice.
